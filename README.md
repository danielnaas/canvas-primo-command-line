# canvas-primo-command-line
An alternate version of the Primo link replacement tool

I've been using this version when I want to queue up a bunch of course numbers and let them run on their own.  You'll need to supply your own Canvas token if you're a UK person.  If you're not a UK person, you'll need to change all the base URLs also.
